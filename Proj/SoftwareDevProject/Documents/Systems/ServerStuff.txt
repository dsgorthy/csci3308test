Changing /var/www/html to point to the web files in the github repo:
First, download the repo to your home folder or wherever you want to save the repo. Then navigate to /var/www/. From this point you need to remove the html directory by running 
	sudo rm -rf html
After we need to create a symbolic link that refers to the directory containing all of the webcontent. This can be done by creating a symbolic link that essentially points to the web content as if it was within the /var/www. The link is created by running the following command:
	sudo ln -S <path to web directory> html
The previous command makes the link with the name "html." The name doesn't have to be html, but if a name aside from html is used, the web server needs to be configured to have its root document set to whatever the path+symlink name is in order to properly serve the web content.
